    Overview
---------------- 

This project was developed starting in summer 2022 as part of the REIN gene networks project. 
Advised by Prof Hillel Kugler and PHD candidate Eitan Tannenbaum as part of the BIU-YU Summer Research program. 

The goal of this project is to indetify inconsistancy cores in .rein files that cause REIN to 
return "No Solutions". This allows users to have a better understanding of why the input data 
falied to return usable results. 

It works by looking at experiments from the input file one at a time and checking if each one
is part of an inconsistancy core. If an experiment is determined to not be part of the core it 
is removed, but if it part of the core, it stays in the file. Once the program has gone 
through each experiemnt, it returns the subset that make up the inconsistancy core.

    Versions
---------------- 

Version 4: this version saves removed experiments into a separate file and makes sure that those experiments don't contian another inconsistancy core. If there is more that one core, program returns both. Also cleaned up some formatting

Version 3: this version ignores lines that are commented out (i.e. begin with //) and includes an option to remove entire experiments at a time (not just lines)
